<h3>
    Welcome to TimeTies, a Cornell Tech Specialization Project.

    <br>
        TimeTies is a visualized NLP analysis on influential relationships over time.
        <br><br>
        We have picked a selection of political and industry leaders and paired them in an effort to understand the thematic narrative of their relationship as portrayed by the mass media.
        Our analysis is based on a proprietary algorithm we built using K-Means clustering.
        We labeled our subsets with the most relevant keywords found across the group's articles.
        <br><br>
        Our data sources include a variety of news agency APIs over a time range from November 2016 to October 2017.

<br> <br>
Please select any of the below pairs to see how their relationship has changed over the past year.</h3>
